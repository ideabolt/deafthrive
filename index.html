          <p>
            Born and raised in Minnesota, Dack Virnig is the fourth-generation Deaf family. He credits his Mom for his storytelling passion with her numerous of fairy tales and her beautiful signs. This passion lead to his first ASL contest, where he placed first. That is when his imagination suddenly emerged and lead to his involvement with High School dramas, five performances for Rochester Institute of Technology and eventually a deaf movie.
 <br><BR>
DackCube Entertainment was an outgrowth of his YouTube fan base who encouraged him to inspire the world with how awesome and beautiful ASL can be. Since then Dack has performed at universities, deaf schools and numerous deaf events where he shares his rich experience in ASL.

<strong>Guests:</strong> <strong>Antoine Hunter</strong> and <strong>Zahna Simon </strong><br><br>
Founded in 2007, a Deaf dancer and choreographer, Anotoine Hunter, lead the Urban Jazz Dance Company (UJDC). Their mission is to provide opportunities for Deaf and other-abled artists to contribute to the arts and larger society, increasing awareness around Deaf issues via the performing arts. Featuring the syncopation of urban jazz rhythms, the company values the importance of play and performance to connect cultures of all races, ages, abilities, and backgrounds. UJDC performs all over the Bay Area and beyond, including at festivals, such as at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Black Choreographers Festival, CubaCaribe Festival, Art and Soul Festival, Oregon Shakespeare Festival's Green Show, and the Ethnic Dance Festival. Its programs thrill Deaf and Hearing audiences alike. UJDC is also the producer of the annual Bay Area International Deaf Dance Festival and views Deafness as a human experience with its own values, principles, and cultural norms – not a disability.

          <p>My parents came to America from El Salvador for different reasons. I am thankful for my parents' decision to make this transformative decision that changed my life forever. I was born in Los Angeles, CA during the times with the infamous LA riot caused by death of Rodney King. That spurred a move to Seattle, WA. I graduated from Gallaudet University in Washington DC with a BA degree in American Sign Language (ASL). I am a translator, ambassador, editor, actor, writer, ASL instructor, guidance counselor for youth, and nursing mentor and among many others.
